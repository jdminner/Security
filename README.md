# Security
For many people Security+ is where the learning starts!  CompTIA recommends a student take Network+ (or have equivalent knowledge) prior to taking Security+.  There is a very good reason for this.  Security+ relys on an understanding of basic networking to apply security principles to.  For example, it is very hard to understand how to securly configure a SOHO WIFI router, if you don't have a solid understanding of how WIFI interacts with clients and how the AP bridges the WIFI and LAN networks. Security+ focuses on intalling and configuring systems, and networks; threat analysis/response; and implementing risk mitigation.  It is the first class in the CompTIA cybersecurity pathway that focuses heavily on specific exploits and how to identify them.  For many instructors, this dangling carrot is too much to resist.  They spend too muh time focusing on exploit tools and demo-ing ethical hacking. While important, these topics should ot take the bulk of the instructor learning time (that's what Penest+ is for...)
